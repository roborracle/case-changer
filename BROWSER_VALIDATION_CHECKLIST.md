This checklist ensures the application's functionality and design are fully validated after the architectural rebuild.

## Server Status
- ✅ Laravel Server: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Confirmed running)
- ✅ Vite Dev Server: Not directly used for core functionality, but assets are built.
- ✅ Production Branch: Ready for deployment with 172 tools and restored UI.

## Core Functionality Validation (Universal Converter)

**Access URL:** http://127.0.0.1:8000

**Test Procedure:**
1.  Load the homepage (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
2.  Verify the overall layout and design match the original specifications (header, hero, universal converter form, categories grid, quick access, footer).
3.  Input test text into the "Your Text" area.
4.  Select various transformations from the "Select Transformation" dropdown.
5.  Click "Transform Text".
6.  Verify the "Result" area displays the correctly transformed text for each selected transformation.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- [ ] All UI elements (header, form, categories, footer) are present and visually correct.
- [ ] The "Select Transformation" dropdown is populated with all 172 transformations.
