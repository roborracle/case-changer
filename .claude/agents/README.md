## How to Use Agents

### In Claude Code
When working in Claude Code, you can invoke agents using the `@agent` syntax:

```
@ui-designer Help me redesign the settings page layout
@backend-architect Design a new API for user preferences
@test-writer-fixer Run tests and fix any failures after my changes
@devops-automator Set up CI/CD for this Laravel project
```

### Choosing the Right Agent

**For Backend Work:**
- Use `backend-architect` for system design and architecture decisions
- Use `backend-developer` for Laravel-specific implementation
- Use `devops-automator` for infrastructure and deployment

**For Frontend/Design:**
- Use `ui-designer` for visual design and component creation
- Use `ux-researcher` for user experience research and validation
- Use `frontend-developer` for implementation

**For Quality & Testing:**
- Use `test-writer-fixer` for comprehensive testing needs
- Use `tool-evaluator` for technology decisions
- Use `task-checker` for quality assurance

**For Project Management:**
- Use `task-orchestrator` for high-level coordination
- Use `task-executor` for hands-on implementation
- Use `task-checker` for validation and QA

## Agent Characteristics

Each agent comes with:
- **Specialized expertise** in their domain
- **Specific tools** they're configured to use
- **Focused workflow** optimized for their tasks
- **Domain knowledge** and best practices
- **Integration awareness** with the project stack

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right agent** for the specific task type
2. **Be specific** about what you need the agent to accomplish
3. **Combine agents** for complex tasks spanning multiple domains
4. **Follow up** with task-checker agent for quality validation
5. **Use task-orchestrator** for coordinating multi-agent workflows

## Project Context

All agents are configured with knowledge of:
- Case Changer Pro Laravel application
- Current tech stack (Laravel, Livewire, Tailwind CSS)
- CSP (Content Security Policy) requirements
- Task Master AI integration
- Rapid development cycle preferences (6-day sprints)

## Notes

- Task Master agents (`task-orchestrator`, `task-executor`, `task-checker`) are project-specific
- Repository agents have been updated with comprehensive expertise
- All agents are configured for the rapid development philosophy
- Agents respect the existing project structure and coding standards
