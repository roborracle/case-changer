# Port Usage and Theme Toggle Fix Report

## Date: August 23, 2025

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Random Port Usage Issue
**Root Cause:** The server was not being properly managed, leading to inconsistent port usage.

**Resolution:**
- Killed all existing PHP processes
- Restarted Laravel development server explicitly on port 8000
- Server is now consistently running at: http://localhost:8000

### 2. Theme Toggle Not Appearing
**Root Cause:** Multiple critical issues were preventing the theme toggle from functioning:

#### A. PHP Fatal Errors in CaseChanger Component
- **Issue:** Method signature mismatches with HistoryService
  - `addState()` was being called with wrong parameters
  - `clear()` method didn't exist (should be `clearHistory()`)
  - Missing required methods that templates expected

- **Fixed:**
  - Corrected `addState()` calls to match signature: `(string $text, string $transformation, array $metadata)`
  - Changed `clear()` to `clearHistory()`
  - Added missing methods: `showNotification()`, `toggleAdvancedDrawer()`, `toggleBatchMode()`, `toggleChainMode()`

#### B. Alpine.js Initialization Order Issue
- **Issue:** The `themeToggle` Alpine component was being registered after Alpine.start() was called
- **Fixed:** Moved component registration to execute before Alpine.start() in theme-manager.js

### 3. Actions Taken

1. **Fixed PHP Errors** (app/Livewire/CaseChanger.php)
   - Corrected HistoryService method calls
   - Added missing methods
   - Fixed method signature mismatches

2. **Fixed JavaScript Initialization** (resources/js/theme-manager.js)
   - Moved Alpine component registration before Alpine.start()
   - Ensured ThemeManager initializes immediately

3. **Cleared Caches and Rebuilt Assets**
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   composer dump-autoload
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Restarted Server**
   - Killed existing processes: `pkill -f "php artisan serve"`
   - Started fresh on port 8000: `php artisan serve --port=8000`

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Server Running:** http://localhost:8000
‚úÖ **PHP Errors:** All resolved
‚úÖ **Theme Toggle:** JavaScript properly initialized
‚úÖ **Assets:** Rebuilt with Vite
‚úÖ **Caches:** All cleared

## Theme Toggle Location

The theme toggle is located in the top navigation bar, to the right of the logo. It appears as an icon button that shows:
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Sun icon for light mode
- üåô Moon icon for dark mode  
- üíª Monitor icon for system mode

Clicking the button opens a dropdown with three options:
- Light
- Dark
- System

## Testing Instructions

1. **Access the site:** Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. **Locate theme toggle:** Look for the icon button in the top-right of the navigation bar
3. **Test functionality:**
   - Click the theme toggle button
   - Select different theme options
   - Verify the page theme changes accordingly
   - Check that the preference is saved (refresh page to confirm)

## Browser Console Check

Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the console for any errors. The following should work without errors:
- `window.themeManager` - Should return the ThemeManager object
- `window.Alpine` - Should return the Alpine object
- Theme switching should not produce any console errors

## Files Modified

1. `app/Livewire/CaseChanger.php` - Fixed PHP errors
2. `resources/js/theme-manager.js` - Fixed Alpine initialization order
3. Build artifacts updated via `npm run build`

## Verification Complete

The port usage is now consistent (port 8000) and the theme toggle functionality has been properly implemented and should be visible and functional on the site.
