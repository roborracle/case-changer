# Product Context

## Project: Case Changer Pro - Architectural Rebuild

## Purpose:
To provide a simple, reliable, and efficient online tool for text transformations, catering to developers, writers, and content creators. The core purpose is to convert text between various formats (case, developer, journalistic, academic, creative, business, social media, technical documentation, international, and utility transformations) without complexity or state management issues.

## Problems Solved:
The architectural rebuild specifically addresses the instability, unpredictability, and high maintenance burden caused by the previous Livewire/Alpine.js implementation. It resolves issues related to state synchronization, untestable code, and performance degradation, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

## User Experience:
The user experience is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. Users input text, select a desired transformation from a comprehensive list, and receive instant, accurate output. The UI is preserved from the original design, ensuring familiarity while benefiting from a stable backend. The focus is on speed, reliability, and ease of use for all 172 available transformations.
