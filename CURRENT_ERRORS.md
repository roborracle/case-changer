## 2. BUILD SYSTEM STATUS

### NPM Build Output:
```
✓ 63 modules transformed.
✓ built in 795ms
```
**Status**: Build succeeds without errors

### Built Files:
- app.js: 49.80 kB (includes Alpine.js)
- app.css: 32.02 kB (includes all styles)
- vendor.js: 41.28 kB (vendor dependencies)

**No build errors detected**

---

## 3. JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE ERRORS (From User Report)

### Critical Alpine.js Error:
```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: Alpine.store is not a function
```
**Issue**: Alpine.store being called before Alpine.plugin(persist) is registered

### Current app.js Structure:
- Line 3: `import persist from '@alpinejs/persist'`
- Line 19: `Alpine.plugin(persist)` - AFTER other imports
- Line 22: `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', ...)` - Uses Alpine.store

**Problem**: The alpine:init event listener is correct, but other JavaScript may be calling Alpine.store before Alpine starts

---

## 4. VISUAL/LAYOUT ISSUES (From User Report)

1. **Navigation Completely Broken**
   - No styling applied
   - Header elements misaligned
   - Dark/light mode toggle not working

2. **Tool Count Display**
   - Showing "172+" instead of "170+"
   - Actual tool count is 172 (verified)
   - User expects 170+ display

3. **Text Areas**
   - User reports no proper styling
   - Code shows correct Tailwind classes applied

---

## 5. SERVER STATUS

- Development server was running on port 8002
- Server killed for clean restart
- No server-side runtime errors detected

---

## 6. CRITICAL FILES TO FIX

1. **resources/js/app.js**
   - Alpine.js initialization order issue
   - Store being accessed before ready

2. **app/Services/TransformationService.php**
   - Duplicate method declarations
   - Methods: toBritishEnglish(), toAddDashes(), toEuFormat()

3. **routes/api.php**
   - Missing rate limiter configuration

4. **Blade Templates**
   - Tool count showing 172+ instead of 170+

---

## 7. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issue:
Alpine.js initialization race condition - Alpine.store is being called somewhere before Alpine.start() completes

### Secondary Issues:
1. Duplicate PHP methods causing fatal errors
2. Missing rate limiter configuration
3. Incorrect tool count display (172+ vs 170+)
4. Possible CSS loading issues

---

## 8. BROWSER CONSOLE ERRORS TO VERIFY

Must check for:
1. Alpine.store is not a function
2. Any 404 errors for CSS/JS files
3. Any CORS or CSP violations
4. Any other JavaScript runtime errors

---

## NEXT STEPS

Will apply the specific Alpine.js fix as provided by user and verify all errors are resolved.
