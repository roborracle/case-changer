# Architecture Decisions - Case Changer

## Decision: Livewire for Real-time Interactivity
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** Laravel 11, Livewire 3
**Context:** Need reactive UI without complex JavaScript framework
**Decision:** Use Livewire for server-side rendering with reactive components
**Rationale:** 
- Simplifies development by keeping logic in PHP
- Reduces JavaScript complexity
- Maintains Laravel ecosystem consistency
- Provides real-time updates without API endpoints
**Consequences:** 
- Benefits: Rapid development, unified codebase, automatic CSRF protection
- Tradeoffs: Server round-trips for each interaction, less suitable for offline mode

## Decision: Tailwind CSS v4 for Styling
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** Tailwind CSS v4.0.0-beta.4
**Context:** Need modern, maintainable CSS framework
**Decision:** Adopt Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
**Rationale:**
- Utility-first approach reduces CSS bloat
- Version 4 offers improved performance
- Excellent Laravel integration
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
**Consequences:**
- Benefits: Consistent design system, small production bundle, responsive by default
- Tradeoffs: Learning curve for utility classes, requires PostCSS setup

## Decision: SQLite for Database
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** SQLite
**Context:** Simple application with no complex data requirements
**Decision:** Use SQLite as database engine
**Rationale:**
- Zero configuration required
- Perfect for single-server deployments
- No separate database server needed
- Sufficient for current feature set
**Consequences:**
- Benefits: Simple deployment, no database server costs, fast local development
- Tradeoffs: Limited concurrent writes, not suitable for horizontal scaling

## Decision: Strategy Pattern for Transformations
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** PHP OOP patterns
**Context:** Multiple text transformation algorithms needed
**Decision:** Implement transformations using method dispatch pattern
**Rationale:**
- Clean separation of transformation logic
- Easy to add new transformations
- Testable individual transformation methods
- Maintainable code structure
**Consequences:**
- Benefits: Extensible architecture, isolated testing, clear code organization
- Tradeoffs: Slightly more complex than procedural approach

## Decision: Client-side Clipboard API
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** JavaScript Clipboard API
**Context:** Need reliable copy-to-clipboard functionality
**Decision:** Use native Clipboard API with Alpine.js
**Rationale:**
- Modern browser standard
- Better security than document.execCommand
- Async operation with promises
- Works across all target browsers
**Consequences:**
- Benefits: Secure clipboard access, user permission handling, async feedback
- Tradeoffs: Requires HTTPS in production, needs fallback for older browsers

## Decision: Vite for Asset Bundling
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** Vite 7.1.2
**Context:** Need modern, fast build tool for Laravel
**Decision:** Use Vite instead of Webpack/Mix
**Rationale:**
- Official Laravel recommendation
- Significantly faster builds
- Better development experience with HMR
- Native ES modules support
**Consequences:**
- Benefits: Fast builds, instant HMR, optimized production bundles
- Tradeoffs: Different configuration from Laravel Mix, requires Node 14+

## Decision: No User Authentication
**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Technology:** Laravel Auth
**Context:** Public utility tool requirements
**Decision:** Operate without user accounts or authentication
**Rationale:**
- Reduces friction for users
- No personal data storage needed
- Simpler infrastructure
- Faster time to market
**Consequences:**
- Benefits: No user management overhead, GDPR compliance simplified, anonymous usage
- Tradeoffs: No user preferences persistence, no usage tracking per user
