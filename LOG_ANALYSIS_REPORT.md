# Clear compiled views to ensure clean state
php artisan view:clear

# Clear application cache
php artisan cache:clear

# Clear configuration cache
php artisan config:clear
```

### 2. Log Rotation (Recommended)
```bash
# Archive old backup log
mv storage/logs/laravel.log.backup-20250904 storage/logs/archive/

# Keep current log as is (168KB is reasonable)
```

### 3. Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Add to .env for better error tracking
LOG_LEVEL=debug
LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL=null
LOG_STACK=single
```

## 🔍 Browser Console Status

Based on previous fixes:
- ✅ Alpine.js errors resolved (100+ errors fixed)
- ✅ CSP violations addressed with nonces
- ⚠️ CSP still includes `'unsafe-eval'` (Livewire requirement)

## 🎯 Action Items

### High Priority
✅ **None** - All critical issues resolved

### Medium Priority
1. Monitor CSP `'unsafe-eval'` usage (documented security concern)
2. Consider log rotation policy for logs > 1MB

### Low Priority
1. Clean up old backup logs periodically
2. Set up automated error alerting for production

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Response Times (Sample)
- Homepage: ~0.08ms - 0.32ms
- Test UI: ~0.25ms
- Assets: ~0.02ms - 0.35ms
- API/Tool: ~5.34ms

### Asset Sizes
- CSS: 89.66 kB (14.04 kB gzipped)
- JavaScript: 203.45 kB (72.54 kB gzipped)
- Both within acceptable ranges

## ✨ Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. ✅ Enable production error logging
2. ✅ Set up error monitoring (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)
3. ✅ Configure log rotation (daily)
4. ⚠️ Address CSP `'unsafe-eval'` if possible

### For Development
1. ✅ Current logging level appropriate
2. ✅ Error handling working correctly
3. ✅ No action needed

## 📝 Conclusion

The application is in **HEALTHY** state with:
- No critical errors
- Minimal error rate (3 errors today, 2 already fixed)
- Good performance metrics
- Clean build process
- Proper error logging

**No immediate action required** - The application is ready for continued development and testing.
