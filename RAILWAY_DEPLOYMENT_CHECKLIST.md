# Railway Deployment Checklist for Case Changer Pro - Post Architectural Rebuild

This document outlines the deployment procedures and verification steps for the rebuilt Case Changer Pro application, which now runs on a stateless, server-rendered PHP architecture with its original UI restored.

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
Ensure these environment variables are set in Railway:

```env
# Application Settings
APP_NAME="Case Changer Pro"
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=[your-app-key]
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=${RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}

# Session & Cache (MUST USE THESE VALUES)
SESSION_DRIVER=cookie
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
SESSION_ENCRYPT=true
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax

CACHE_STORE=array

# Database (No database used in this stateless application)
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=:memory:

# Logging
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
LOG_LEVEL=error

# Filesystem (Disabled - no file persistence)
FILESYSTEM_DISK=null

# Broadcasting & Queue (Not used in this stateless application)
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=null
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

### 2. Build Configuration (nixpacks.toml)
Verify `nixpacks.toml` contains:
- ✅ NPM build command for Vite assets (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Composer install with `--optimize-autoloader`
- ✅ Laravel cache commands (config, routes, views)
- ✅ NO database migrations (as there is no persistent database)

### 3. Code Verification

#### Core Architecture
- ✅ `TransformationService.php`: Contains all 172 transformation methods, is stateless, and pure.
- ✅ `TransformationController.php`: Handles HTTP requests, delegates to `TransformationService`, and renders views.
- ✅ `home.blade.php`: Uses a standard HTML form to submit to `TransformationController::transform`.
- ✅ `resources/js/app.js`: Contains only essential JavaScript (e.g., `bootstrap.js`), with no Alpine.js or other reactive framework imports.
- ✅ `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`: `\URL::forceScheme('https')` is enabled for `production` environment.
- ✅ `public/index.php`: Railway proxy detection is enabled for `production` environment.

#### File Operations
- ✅ No file write attempts in application logic.
- ✅ Logging: Using `stderr`, not file-based.
- ✅ Sessions: Using `cookie` driver, not files.
- ✅ Cache: Using `array` driver, not files.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Local Verification
```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Build assets
npm run build

# Start server for local testing (use an available port, e.g., 8000)
php artisan serve --port=8000
```

### 2. Git Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Architectural Rebuild: Replaced Livewire/Alpine with stateless PHP backend, restored original UI, and migrated all 172 transformations. Updated documentation."
git push origin main # Or your deployment branch
```

### 3. Railway Deployment
1. Push to your deployment branch (e.g., `main`) triggers deployment.
2. Monitor build logs for:
   - NPM build success
   - Composer install success
   - Cache generation success
3. Check runtime logs for any 500 errors.

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Test Core Functionality
1.  **Homepage Load**: Access `https://[YOUR_RAILWAY_DOMAIN]` (or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` locally). Should display without 500 errors.
2.  **Universal Converter**:
    *   Input text into the "Your Text" area.
    *   Select various transformations from the "Select Transformation" dropdown.
    *   Click "Transform Text".
    *   Verify the "Result" area displays the correctly transformed text for each selected transformation.
3.  **All 172 Tools**: Ensure all tools are listed in the dropdown and function correctly.
4.  **No Persistence Tests**:
    *   History should NOT persist between page reloads.
    *   All state should be request-scoped.

#### Monitor Logs
Check Railway logs for:
- ❌ File write attempts
- ❌ Database connection errors
- ❌ Session file errors
- ❌ Cache file errors
- ✅ Clean `stderr` output only

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: 500 Error on Homepage
**Cause**: Missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, or PHP errors.
**Solution**: Check Railway build and runtime logs for specific error messages. Ensure `APP_KEY` is set.

### Issue: "This site can't be reached" or SSL errors locally
**Cause**: Browser HSTS caching for `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
**Solution**: Clear browser HSTS cache for `localhost` or use `127.0.0.1` in an incognito window. The server is confirmed to serve HTTP.

## Production Principles

### What This App IS:
- ✅ A stateless text converter
- ✅ A single-page tool (in terms of core interaction)
- ✅ Request-scoped processing
- ✅ Server-rendered UI with minimal client-side JavaScript

### What This App IS NOT:
- ❌ A database-driven application
- ❌ A user account system
- ❌ A data persistence platform
- ❌ A file storage service
- ❌ A client-side reactive application (Livewire/Alpine.js removed)

## Emergency Rollback

If deployment fails:
1. Revert to previous deployment in Railway dashboard.
2. Check environment variables haven't changed.
3. Verify `nixpacks.toml` is present.
4. Ensure git branch is clean.

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- ✅ All pages load without 500 errors.
- ✅ All 172 converters work correctly via the main form.
- ✅ No file/database errors in logs.
- ✅ HTTPS works correctly in production (HTTP locally).
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (<2s page load).
- ✅ The UI matches the original design specifications.

**Remember**: This is a SIMPLE TEXT CONVERTER. Don't over-engineer it!
