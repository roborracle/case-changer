# API Endpoints - Production Deployment Note

## IMPORTANT: Review Before Railway Production Deployment

### Current Status
- API endpoints implemented primarily for **testing purposes**
- Located in `/api/categories` and `/api/transform`
- Provide REST interface to existing PHP TransformationService

### Security Considerations for Production
Before deploying to Railway, review:

1. **Necessity Assessment**
   - [ ] Determine if API endpoints are needed in production
   - [ ] If not needed, consider disabling in production environment
   - [ ] If needed, implement additional security measures

2. **If Keeping APIs in Production**
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting (currently basic)
   - [ ] Add API authentication if exposing publicly
   - [ ] Set strict text length limits
   - [ ] Add CloudFlare or similar DDoS protection
   - [ ] Monitor for abuse

3. **If Removing APIs in Production**
   - [ ] Set environment variable `API_ENABLED=false`
   - [ ] Conditionally register routes based on environment
   - [ ] Update tests to skip API tests in production

### Implementation Details
- APIs expose same functionality as Livewire components
- No database writes or sensitive operations
- Text transformation only - no code execution
- CSRF excluded for `/api/*` routes (standard for APIs)

### Recommendation
Consider making API endpoints **development/staging only** unless there's a specific production use case.
