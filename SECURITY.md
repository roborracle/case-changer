# Case Changer Pro - Security Documentation (Post Architectural Rebuild)

## Production Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Case Changer Pro application for production deployment, following the architectural rebuild to a stateless, server-rendered PHP backend.

## Security Architecture Overview

The application now operates on a simplified, stateless architecture, inherently reducing many attack vectors associated with client-side state management. Security is primarily enforced at the server and network layers:

1.  **Network Security** - DDoS protection, rate limiting (handled by infrastructure/middleware)
2.  **Application Security** - Input validation, output encoding, CSRF protection
3.  **Data Security** - Secure sessions (cookie-based), data sanitization (no persistent database)
4.  **Infrastructure Security** - Security headers, HTTPS enforcement, CSP

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Middleware Stack

The application uses a layered middleware approach (defined in `bootstrap/app.php` and `app/Http/Middleware`):

```php
ForceHttps::class          // HTTPS enforcement (production only)
DDoSProtection::class      // DDoS attack mitigation
SecurityHeaders::class     // Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
RateLimiting::class        // Request throttling
```

### 2. Security Headers (`SecurityHeaders.php`)

#### Production Headers:
-   **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff`
-   **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY`
-   **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block`
-   **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
-   **Permissions-Policy**: Restrictive permissions
-   **Strict-Transport-Security**: `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
-   **Content-Security-Policy**: Restrictive CSP with nonce support

#### Content Security Policy:
-   `Default-src`: `'self'` + approved domains
-   `Script-src`: `'self'` with nonce + Google Analytics (if used)
-   `Style-src`: `'self'` `'unsafe-inline'`
-   `Frame-ancestors`: `'none'`
-   `Upgrade-insecure-requests` enabled

### 3. Rate Limiting (`RateLimiting.php`)

Multiple rate limit tiers are configured:
-   **Default**: 60 requests/minute
-   **API**: 30 requests/minute
-   **Conversion**: 100 requests/minute
-   **Strict**: 10 requests/minute
-   **Global**: 1000 requests/minute

Features:
-   IP-based tracking
-   SHA1 request signatures
-   Automatic blocking on limit exceeded
-   `Retry-After` headers

### 4. DDoS Protection (`DDoSProtection.php`)

Multi-level protection is implemented:
-   **Per-second limit**: 10 requests
-   **Per-minute limit**: 100 requests
-   **Per-hour limit**: 1000 requests
-   **Auto-blocking**: 1-hour blocks for violations

Suspicious behavior detection:
-   Bot/crawler user agents
-   Missing user agents
-   Rapid endpoint scanning
-   Pattern-based detection

### 5. Input Validation (`TransformationController` and `SecurityService.php`)

Comprehensive validation is performed on all user inputs:
-   **Length limits**: 10KB max text input for transformations.
-   **Pattern detection**: `SecurityService` can be used for detecting dangerous patterns (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
-   **Type validation**: Ensures inputs match expected types (e.g., string).

Sanitization methods:
-   HTML entity encoding
-   Null byte removal
-   Control character stripping
-   Type-specific sanitization

### 6. Request Validation (`TextTransformationRequest.php`)

Form request validation ensures:
-   Rate limit checking
-   Origin validation
-   Input sanitization
-   Maximum character limits

### 7. Session Security

Configuration (`.env.railway`):
-   **Driver**: `cookie` (stateless application, sessions are minimal and cookie-backed)
-   **Lifetime**: 120 minutes
-   **Secure cookies**: Production only
-   **HttpOnly**: Enabled
-   **SameSite**: `Lax`

### 8. Logging & Monitoring

Dedicated logging channels:
-   **security.log**: Security events (30-day retention)
-   **performance.log**: Performance metrics (7-day retention)
-   **audit.log**: User actions (90-day retention)

Logged events:
-   Authentication attempts (if applicable)
-   Rate limit violations
-   Suspicious activities
-   Input validation failures
-   DDoS attack patterns

### 9. CORS Configuration

API-specific CORS:
-   Whitelisted origins only
-   Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
-   Credentials: Not allowed
-   Max-Age: 86400 seconds

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Production Environment
-   HTTPS enforced (via `AppServiceProvider` and `public/index.php`)
-   Strict CSP with nonce
-   Production domains whitelisted
-   Debug mode disabled
-   Error logging only

### Development Environment
-   Localhost allowed in CSP
-   Relaxed CORS for testing
-   Debug mode enabled
-   Verbose logging
-   HTTPS enforcement temporarily disabled in `AppServiceProvider` and `public/index.php` for local HTTP access.

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1.  **Never trust user input** - Always validate and sanitize.
2.  **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection (though not directly applicable to this stateless app, good practice).
3.  **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular Composer and NPM updates.
4.  **Use HTTPS everywhere** - Ensure production deployments enforce HTTPS.
5.  **Implement proper error handling** - Never expose stack traces in production.

### For Operations

1.  **Regular security audits** - Quarterly penetration testing.
2.  **Monitor logs** - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns.
3.  **Keep Laravel updated** - Apply security patches promptly.
4.  **Backup regularly** - Maintain encrypted backups (if any data persistence is added).
5.  **Incident response plan** - Document security incident procedures.
