# Progress Log

This document tracks the progress of the Case Changer Pro architectural rebuild.

## Working Features:
-   **Core Transformation Engine:** The `TransformationService` is fully implemented with 172 distinct text transformation methods.
-   **Stateless Backend:** The application operates on a stateless PHP backend, ensuring predictability and scalability.
-   **Original UI Restoration:** The `home.blade.php`, `navigation.blade.php`, and `footer.blade.php` views have been restored to their original design, with Alpine.js directives removed for a static frontend.
-   **Comprehensive Testing:** A robust unit test suite (`tests/Unit/TransformationServiceTest.php`) validates all 172 transformations.
-   **Documentation:** `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `BROWSER_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `TOOL_CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md` have been updated.

## Remaining Work:
-   Final review of all documentation.
-   Commit and push all changes to the repository.

## Known Issues:
-   None. The application is stable and fully functional as per the architectural rebuild mandate.
