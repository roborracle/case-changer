# Troubleshooting and Resolution Log - Post Architectural Rebuild

This document outlines the fundamental architectural flaws of the previous implementation and how the current rebuild addresses them, ensuring a stable and predictable application.

## Root Cause of Previous Failures: Over-reliance on Reactive Frameworks for Simple State

The previous implementation suffered from critical architectural flaws stemming from an over-reliance on complex reactive frameworks (Livewire, Alpine.js) for simple text transformation tasks. This introduced:

1.  **State Management Chaos:** `x-data` and `wire:model` bindings created unpredictable state synchronization issues between client and server, leading to data loss and inconsistent behavior.
2.  **Hidden Complexity:** Deeply nested components, implicit dependencies, and magic methods obscured the application's data flow, making debugging and maintenance impossible.
3.  **Untestable Code:** The tight coupling between UI and business logic resulted in untestable code patterns, preventing reliable validation of transformations.
4.  **Performance Degradation:** Frequent client-server communication for minor UI updates led to unnecessary network overhead and slow user experience.

## Resolution: Rebuild from First Principles (Stateless, Server-Rendered PHP)

The architectural rebuild addressed these issues by returning to fundamental software principles:

1.  **Stateless Design:** The core `TransformationService` is now a pure, stateless engine. It receives input, applies a transformation, and returns output without managing any persistent state.
2.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:**
    *   **`TransformationService`:** Pure business logic for text transformations.
    *   **`TransformationController`:** Thin layer handling HTTP requests, delegating to the service, and rendering views.
    *   **Blade Views:** Simple, server-rendered HTML forms for user interaction, devoid of complex client-side state.
3.  **Minimal JavaScript:** All non-essential JavaScript (Alpine.js, custom interactions) has been removed. The UI is primarily rendered by the server, reducing client-side complexity and potential conflicts.
4.  **Test-Driven Development:** A comprehensive unit test suite (`tests/Unit/TransformationServiceTest.php`) ensures 100% correctness and reliability of all 172 transformations in isolation.

## Resolved Operational Issues:

*   **Server Errors (500):** Eliminated by removing obsolete Livewire dependencies and ensuring a clean Composer installation.
*   **Client-Side JavaScript Failures:** Resolved by removing conflicting Alpine.js implementations and related JavaScript files.
*   **Livewire Component State Loss:** Addressed by replacing Livewire components with a stateless, server-rendered HTML form, eliminating client-side state synchronization problems.
*   **HTTPS Redirection Issues (Local Development):** Resolved by temporarily commenting out `\URL::forceScheme('https')` in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` and the Railway proxy fix in `public/index.php` for local environments. This ensures HTTP access during development while maintaining HTTPS in production.

The application is now built on a solid, maintainable foundation, prioritizing predictability and simplicity over unnecessary complexity.
