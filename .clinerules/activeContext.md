# Active Context

## Project: Case Changer Pro - Architectural Rebuild

## Current Focus:
Completing the documentation and preparing for final handoff after a successful architectural rebuild and UI restoration.

## Recent Changes:
-   **Backend:** Replaced Livewire/Alpine.js with a stateless PHP backend using `TransformationService` and `TransformationController`.
-   **Frontend:** Restored original Blade views (`home.blade.php`, `navigation.blade.php`, `footer.blade.php`) and removed all Alpine.js directives and related JavaScript.
-   **Functionality:** All 172 text transformations are implemented and integrated into the universal converter form.
-   **Routing:** Restored original routes and re-configured homepage to use `TransformationController`.
-   **HTTPS:** Disabled local HTTPS enforcement in `AppServiceProvider` and `public/index.php` for development, re-enabled for production.
-   **Documentation:** Updated `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `BROWSER_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `TOOL_CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Active Decisions:
-   Prioritizing comprehensive documentation to ensure a smooth handoff.
-   Ensuring all aspects of the rebuild are clearly articulated and validated.
-   Confirming the application is fully functional and visually consistent with the original design.
