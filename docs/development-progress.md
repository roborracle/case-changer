### Technical Implementation Details

#### Architecture
- **Component**: `App\Livewire\CaseChanger` - Main transformation component
- **View**: `resources/views/livewire/case-changer.blade.php` - UI template
- **Layout**: `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` - Main layout with clipboard functionality
- **Route**: `/case-changer` - Public access endpoint
- **Patterns**: Strategy Pattern for transformations, Service Layer architecture

#### Key Technical Solutions
1. **PHP Quote Escaping**: Used Unicode escape sequences (\u{201C}, \u{201D}, \u{2018}, \u{2019}) to handle smart quotes
2. **Tailwind CSS Stability**: 
   - Downgraded from v4 to v3.4.17 for production stability
   - Updated PostCSS configuration
   - Proper asset compilation and serving
3. **Livewire Integration**: Full reactive server-side rendering with Alpine.js for client interactions
4. **Security Implementation**: Input validation (100KB limit), UTF-8 encoding checks, comprehensive error handling
5. **Performance Optimization**: All caches optimized, production build completed

### Issues Resolved

#### Issue 1: Missing Livewire Layout (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: "Livewire page component layout view not found: [components.layouts.app]"
- **Solution**: Created missing layout file with proper clipboard functionality
- **Prevention**: Always verify Livewire layout exists after component creation

#### Issue 2: CSS Not Loading (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: No styling present, CSS served as JavaScript instead of CSS
- **Solution**: Built production assets and switched from dev to production mode
- **Prevention**: Use production build for browser validation

#### Issue 3: Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility
- **Problem**: PostCSS plugin moved to separate package, utility classes not generating
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Tailwind v3.4.17 for stability
- **Prevention**: Check Tailwind version requirements before major updates

#### Issue 4: PHP Parse Error in Smart Quotes
- **Problem**: Syntax error with quote escaping in preg_replace patterns
- **Solution**: Used Unicode escape sequences for smart quote characters
- **Prevention**: Always use Unicode escapes for special characters in regex patterns

#### Issue 5: Security Vulnerabilities
- **Problem**: No input validation, potential DOS attacks with large inputs
- **Solution**: Added 100KB limit and comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Prevention**: Implement input validation at boundaries

#### Issue 6: Style Guide Differentiation
- **Problem**: All style guides produced identical output
- **Solution**: Implemented real style guide rules with meaningful differences
- **Prevention**: Test each style guide implementation against official rules

#### Issue 7: Property Mismatch Error
- **Problem**: View was using `transformedText` but component used `outputText`
- **Solution**: Updated view to use correct property name
- **Prevention**: Maintain consistent property naming across component and view

#### Issue 8: UTF-8 Support
- **Problem**: No Unicode validation or proper character handling
- **Solution**: Added UTF-8 validation and proper multibyte string handling
- **Prevention**: Always validate text encoding for international users
